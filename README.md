## Authentication

This project uses **Lucia** for authentication. Lucia provides a robust and flexible authentication solution, allowing you to easily implement user registration, login, and session management.

## Database

By default, this project uses MySQL as its database with the DrizzleORM driver. If you wish to change the database configuration, you can refer to the official Lucia documentation for guidance.
